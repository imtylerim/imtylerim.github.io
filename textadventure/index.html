			The yellow-white light comes crackling alive. The familiar smell of dirty laundry. The door closes shut behind you.
		</p>
		<p>
			You pull the straps of your bag off and drop it on the floor and fall back onto the mattress, face up. For a few moments you just lie there, staring up at the ceiling. 
		</p>
		<p>
			You heave a deep sigh.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's 8:00 on a Friday night, and your friends have invited you to a house party two blocks away. You haven't gone out in a while, and you know the feeling of being shit-faced drunk would do you some good. But you've got a decent stack of work you were planning to get done tonight. And you also haven't been keeping up with your favorite TV show recently. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Choices, choices. What do you do?
