		<h1>
			happy birthday, my dear, sweet, loving, generous, kind, thoughtful, warm, caring, creative, beautiful, cute, sexy, funny and AMAZING PARTNER!!!
		</h1>
		<p>
			it's been 2 years and 5 months since that summer night on the rooftop of 188 claremont.
			it feels so fucking long ago that i was spooning you with a faceful of blond hair and we were hooking up 
			on a mattress on the floor with a ratty gray cover, staying up until 4 am, feeding each other frozen strawberries, singing along to SZA.
			things were so different back then! of course i miss the freedom of not being tied to a 9-5 work schedule, and i miss the ease and intimacy of sharing one home (a joy 
			we will rediscover next year!). 
		<p>
			but there are also so many things i love about you and about our relationship that have only come with time. 
			i love all the things i know about you and that you know about me. i love the deep feeling of trust and security you give me; i feel it especially 
			when we fall asleep together. i love how much we play together, verbally and physically. 
		</p>
		<p>
			i'm grateful for how you've pushed me to grow and explore and change, in my politics, in my daily life, in my ways of finding and feeling joy.
			it feels like we've been together forever and always will be. i want to share everything with you!
		</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			Happy 21st Birthday.
		</p>
		<p>
			Yours,
		</p>
		<p>
			Tybb
