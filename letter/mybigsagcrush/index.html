		<h1>
			happy birthday, my dear, sweet, loving, generous, kind, thoughtful, warm, caring, creative, beautiful, cute, sexy, funny and AMAZING PARTNER!!!
		</h1>
		<p>
			since that summer night on the rooftop of 188 claremont, we've been together for 2 years and 5 months. 
			it feels so fucking long ago that i was spooning you with a faceful of blond hair and we were hooking up 
			on a mattress on the floor with a ratty gray cover, staying up until 4 am, feeding each other frozen strawberries, singing along to SZA.
		</p>
		<p>
			things were so different back then!! easier in some ways, but more difficult in others. i'm grateful for how much we've grown together since then.
			i'm grateful for how you've pushed me to grow and explore and change, in my politics, in my fashion, in my ways of finding and feeling joy. 

			it feels like we've been together forever and always will be. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Happy 21st Birthday.
		</p>
		<p>
			Yours,
		</p>
		<p>
			Tybb
